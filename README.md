Files for my minecraft client

## Install - Same for All Systems

Download the latest zip file from the releases tab. Then unzip and move the folder inside the zip file into your minecraft/versions directory.

**MAKE SURE THE FOLDER YOU PUT IN THE VERSIONS DIRECTLY HAS THE JSON AND JAR FILE**

Open the Minecraft launcher and navigate to the **Installations** tab. Click on "New Installation" and give the install a name. Scroll down to 1.8 in the version tab, and right before the official 1.8 release is creative client. Select that, then launch the version normally by selecting it in the **Play** Tab.
